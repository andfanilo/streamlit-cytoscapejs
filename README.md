# Streamlit Cytoscape.js

Streamlit wrapper of [React Cytoscape.js](https://github.com/plotly/react-cytoscapejs).

**NB**: This is a very early release, pardon the dust.

Obviously missing lots of things like:

- custom layout
- adding an extension (but also you'd better fork this repo and add the extension yourself I think :/)
